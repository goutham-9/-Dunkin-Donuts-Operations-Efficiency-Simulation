This project focused on improving the efficiency of Dunkin's walk-in and drive-thru services through a detailed simulation model. This model analyzed customer wait times, queue lengths, and service utilization to identify key areas for operational improvement using Jaamsim model. The project's findings suggested that adding an additional operator for the drive-thru service could significantly reduce customer wait times and improve overall service efficiency. Skills emphasized in this project included simulation modeling, statistical analysis, and Python programming, alongside operational analysis and data visualization to present findings effectively.
